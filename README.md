## Installation

Run first setup for platform and then 'setup. sh' - it should check for core dependencies + try to install some stuff if missing.
Those are small files, just read them to understand what's happening.

## TPM notes

Remember to install plugins after running tmux for first time - `C-A -> I`. I always forget.
